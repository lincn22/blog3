        Cosmetic surgery, also known as aesthetic surgery, encompasses a wide range of procedures aimed at enhancing a person's appearance. From facial rejuvenation to body contouring, the spectrum of available treatments is vast and continuously evolving. Whether it's correcting perceived flaws, reversing signs of aging, or achieving a desired aesthetic, cosmetic surgery offers solutions tailored to individual needs.

      <p class="w3-opacity"><i>What are the procedures?</i></p><br>
      <p class="w3-left-align w3-white w3-text-black">
        Cosmetic surgery procedures can be broadly categorized into surgical and non-surgical interventions. Surgical procedures involve invasive techniques such as facelifts, breast augmentation, rhinoplasty (nose job), and liposuction, among others. These interventions often require downtime for recovery but can deliver dramatic and long-lasting results.

        On the other hand, non-surgical procedures provide alternatives with minimal downtime and lower risk. These include treatments like Botox injections, dermal fillers, chemical peels, and laser therapy, which target specific concerns such as wrinkles, volume loss, and skin texture irregularities. While non-surgical procedures offer less permanent changes compared to surgery, they provide quick fixes and are often preferred for their convenience.
